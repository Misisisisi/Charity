# Charity

Charity is a place where everyone can donate unnecessary things to trusted institutions. 
In the first step, the user selects which category of gifts he wants to donate, then he 
indicates how many bags he has packed the things into and selects which organization he 
wants to donate. In the last step, the user provides the address, contact details and 
the date of receipt of the goods by the courier.
